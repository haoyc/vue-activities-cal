# Vue Activites App

> This is a little component from recently built Canyon Ranch site for their Activities Calendar. I built a corresponding wordpress plugin that imports activities from spreadsheet upload and this is just the frontend presentation of that data which shows a daily breakdown of activities and a calendar datepicker.

## Notes

 * Canyon Ranch's Data schema can be found here: sample-data/cr-sample-data-schema.json
 * One month sample faker data will be displayed if global var `activitiesDadta` not provided.
 * Global site-wide Tooltips ad Wishlist functionality's disabled here


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
